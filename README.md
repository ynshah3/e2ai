# The E2AI Literacy Project: Introducing Ethical and Explainable AI to Students

## Objectives

1. Advocating for AI Literacy for anyone interacting with AI, especially inclusion in K-12 curriculum along with other literacy teachings like financial, sex, nutrition, health, etc.

2. Gaining competence in not just using and applying “off-the-shelf” pre-trained models developed by large corporations and organizations and treating them as “black boxes”, but learning to understand the data, AI’s interaction with that data, interpreting how it works, and keeping in mind ethical considerations around privacy, diversity and inclusion, equal access, bias, and sustainability.

3. With the prevalence of large foundational text models (at least among people with privileged access to electricity, the internet, and computer literacy, among others) and the ushering into a digital era, learning AI competencies that make mindful, inquiring, and practical student leaders.
